The journey in the Yelp-like application is continuing.
Today we worked on [data validations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) via Active Record, which is the Rails layer responsible for the model and data handling.

I am quite exausted so I don't feel like writing a long post. But I'm quite happy with what we have done so far.

We are able to handle data insertion, validation and handle events on the web page via [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29).

I think I'll try a better overview of the application when I'll see it finished.

And shout outs to KA, whose [Night's Gambit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1hDpufNXd0) is helping me to be up till late working.

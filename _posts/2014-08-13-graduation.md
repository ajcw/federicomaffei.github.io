It's often wise to sit down and let some time pass after something important happens in your life, before trying to get some sense out of it, especially if you want to write some stuff about it.

I am a Makers Academy graduate, in the end. This has been a wild ride. Something I will not forget, ever.

Graduation day has been very similar to the whole experience: a rollercoaster of emotions, good and bad ones, as often happens in 25, City Road. My cohort mates' projects were all incredible and clearly showed eveyone how people get real skills here.

Let's start talking a bit about the good things and peoples: 

* The project, which has been an invaluable test for both coding and working in a team. I would be really glad if you, kind reader, would like to check the final product out at:

* The classmates and teammates, people that will go very far in life, all of them, I have no doubt about that. I hope not to lose contact with anyone, and I will put effort in making sure that doesn't happen.

* The teachers and coaches, which I will never thank enough for their dedication, patience and commitment.

* Everyone working for Makers. The team is extraordinary, and made of lovely people who also make great professionals.

* Me. I usually refrain from patting myself on the back, but all in all I feel proud of myself. It's not easy to endure such an intensive class, and I did it, even with a broken arm. Well done!

The only bad things that I can think of is that I didn't like the presentation speech I gave to explain part of the final project to the people attending the graduation Open Day. I got too emotional, did not manage to talk the way I wanted about the amazing features my team built. I want to improve on that, and together with finding a good job, this is now my most important task to do. Public speaking is important, and I know I can do better.

Makers never stops teaching you lessons, right?

Anyway, off to the seaside. I'll use the blog to talk about coding anyway in the future, so this won't be the last time you hear from me. Thanks for reading, I be out.

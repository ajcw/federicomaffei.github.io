I'm not blogging every day now, and I regret it a little bit.. I don't feel like doing so, and I prefer to save the only working hand I have left for coding as much as I can.

The days at Makers are long, we are still stuck on the battleships project that the class started when I was home, and no one seems to enjoy it that much. I am trying really hard to be level with the class, hoping to be better soon and kick ass.

On Monday Will gave me a little plastic scooter that I enjoyed very much. Overall I tried to have the best start of the week possible.

Here I am now, exhausted at home, typing with my left hand and trying to keep optimistic. Can't go much worse than now, anyway!
The last six months have been a rollercoaster of events and feelings. I made some big decisions. I felt awful at times, angry with the world and with people. This is my escape, I felt so better after making up my mind, and I'll go all the way, no matter what.

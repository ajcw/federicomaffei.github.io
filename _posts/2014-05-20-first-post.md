All right, here I am. Blogging for the first time in my life, about something that I'm doing for the first time in my life.

Coding.

I've been telling myself to open up this blog since day one here at Makers, but really did not even have the time to actually do it, until now. And of course promised myself to keep on updating it.

The first week has been a real rollercoaster. I got to meet my cohort mates, which I'm sure I'll get to know better over the next weeks, and I dived into the code. Today I paired with Sasha, and it was really useful, I got a lot out of it.

Basically we got our hands dirty on a project that involves a directory of students, and has the purpose of getting us in the right frame of mind.

Enrique, our teacher for this first week, then gave us a coding Kata (that's what they call them) to complete over the weekend.
This is the result, ready for you to watch on Vimeo. Check it!

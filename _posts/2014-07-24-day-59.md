Hectic day today, started with the usual Standup Meeting with Jordan. Here's all the team, glorious screenshot.

Then we went on with the development of our creature, WorkMap. The deadline to deliver a shippable product, as per Agile specifications, is this Sunday. Then we'll begin the second and last Sprint.

This means a rush of four days, in which we have to tackle 3 main aims:

* Be sure that all the jobs inserted by the employer are in the map, and allow the user to filter them.

* Make a good looking landing page.

* Be sure that the employer can edit the jobs he inserted, and pays for the newly added advert.

Today I have been working with Robin, trying to tackle the jobs filtering on the map. It turned out that all the code that I wrote to make checkboxes filter results was pretty useless, since now we settled for a filtering form, allow us to render the results of the search in [JSON format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). This way we can pass all the information related to jobs from the Rails back end to the Javascript front end, and viceversa.

Anyway, two full days of work to Sunday. Better get some rest, yo.

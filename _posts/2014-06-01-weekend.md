Plans are great, unless they fail and leave you diving deep into a shit pool.

How it was supposed to be: go to Italy, [attend wedding and party with old time friends like there's no tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlrqaAjBwS4), take a plane on Monday morning and be at Makers by lunch.

How it actually went: a scooter ran over me on Saturday night, my right shoulder broke in two points, spent the night at the hospital, still went to the wedding and tried to drink away the pain, woke up today in the worst pain I ever experienced.

Now, stuck here in Italy for the next two days, I'm awaiting for a x-ray check, unable to write or do anything else with my arm, and not sleeping from pain. But still trying to be optimistic and not give up.

Not give up.

I will not give up.

I will not give up.

I will not give up.

I will not give up.

I will not give up.

I will not give up.

I will not give up.

Erick Sermon and Parish Smith know [their shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noegD-jIw5Y).

Today I bumped hard their album Back in Business. Why?

Federico is like a Beatle, back with another single! Yes, I'm back in London, back at Makers, and back for good.

I have been in a hospital in Italy, on a plane to UK and at school until 19 pm all the same day. So excuse me while I kiss my pillow. Nite!

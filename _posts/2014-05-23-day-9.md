Today has been a day of highs and lows.




It started quite low and went progressively better until the afternoon.
It is Friday, end of the second week, and I'm just tired as you could imagine.
I completed the code challenge with no particular struggling (it was quite easy), then I went on programming a little bit by myself, until we were all (us and the March cohort) caught in the Retrospective, that is a way for the coaches to have feedback and comments for us.

I felt quite relieved in seeing I am not the only one feeling a little bit lost sometimes, and that it is normal not to finish a weekly project in time.

I am strongly motivated to get my next week to be way better than this one, and reach the goal of making more questions and participate more during the lectures. We'll see. In the meanwhile, I'm off to a few drinks. 

GOOD WEEKEND LADS!

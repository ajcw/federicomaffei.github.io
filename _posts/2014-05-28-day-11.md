Giant leaps forward this week at Makers.
Today we started talking seriously about the concepts of [encapsulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29) and [class inheritance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29).

Basically it takes what we've learned so far about classes to another level, allowing us to take advantage of similarities between classes, and extending them using the methods we already declared.

The day was productive, I paired with Johann and we completed a good part of the week project.

Off-topic: I am so glad it is Wednesday and I can go relieve my stress in a football pitch. [Big Wednesday!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hFH3q5bz1Q)

title: Day 10 - A real player needs Class.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Player
	def initialize

	end

	def after_this_tuesday
		@knows_about_classes = true
	end
end

And we're back, after a long long weekend. The week started with a big juicy lecture about Ruby [classes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29).
Now some pieces of the puzzle are starting to combine in a nice way altogether.

I feel really tired and not too keen on blogging about the whole day, that has been basically devoted to understand the basics of [OOD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design) and [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) with a bit of CRC cards.

What does all of it mean? We'll see, maybe I'll explain in a longer post soon. For now what I got is that objects and classes are like people and behave like people, and I don't know if a plus or a minus.

But overall good day, with a lot of new stuff to learn. Really looking forward to be in class again tomorrow.

And now, speaking of class, how did you expect an Italian would end this post?

Long live Roberto.

Tough day, this second project day, definitely tougher than yesterday.

The team is still going strong, but I can feel we are slowly drifting away from our comfort zone (Rails and a bit of front end), to begin exploring the unknown.

The vast majority of the application we want to delivery next Sunday is based on [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/), and the challenges related are many. We want to be able to store job into markers, show and hide them according to the user input, and allow a pop-up with info to appear when a marker is clicked.

Today has been fairly productive, but I don't want to talk too much too soon. Everyone is working hard, and it feels good to be finally functional, typing with both my hands and not feeling pain. A sensation I learned not to take for granted.

Off to sleep, yo.

[Friday, venerdÃ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8mht4FuVrU), again.
After a quick calculation, that can be done without any coding, one third of the course already flew.

33,3333333333%.

Today was challenge day, and I must say I find myself really at ease while trying to complete the test, way more than following the code proposed in the weekly project. It was something related to traffic control applied to the case of an airport. Nothing too difficult, it took me three hours to go through it and it was interesting.

But anyway, enough with the coding adventures. Tomorrow at 6am I have to catch a plane to [my hometown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancona), and I'll be there for a couple of days to attend the wedding of one of my best friends.
I can't wait to be there, it's been quite long since last time I've been there. I'll post a couple pictures of the wedding on Monday.

Ah, and my beard is starting to look like a real coder's one.

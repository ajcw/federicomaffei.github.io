Intense week, as the Makers clich√© wants.

I am not updating the blog as much as I want, but it is not too easy with only one hand at my disposal.

We are approaching the sixth week, and in a while we will enter the second half of the course and become seniors. Time fled, as always when you do something that you enjoy a lot.

Right now the project we are working on is allowing us to put some pieces together: modeling data with the help of DataMapper, an [Object Relational Mapper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch), writing the main application in Ruby, and the user interface in ERB, which is basically still Ruby, but embedded in HTML. I feel like I'm ready to write more descriptive posts about coding, and I'll start doing so as soon as I remove the bendage.

I still feel somehow confused by the amount of new information being thrown at me each day, but slowly getting used to it. And coding has a big upside: you can do it while listening to music, and this is giving me the chance to go through all of my favorite albums.

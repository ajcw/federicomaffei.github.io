There is no love without hate, [if the Wu Tang says so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcmGMggfgec), I believe them.

Currently this is my feeling towards Ruby: I really enjoy learning it, but today it gave me hell.

What can I say: my day at Makers started just fine - but during the day it definitely turned out to be difficult, to say the least. I worked hard on the [rspec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec) Student Directory project, and banged my head on several development problems, that I did not manage to tackle at all. Nic and Jamie helped me and gave me a couple of good hints, but I'm still stuck on grasping some small but apparently important concepts.

I tried to handle user input tests by implementing mocking, but it turned out that it was not that fun. Plus I stumbled upon several articles that incresed my skepticalness on it being useful. 

Anyway, at 7pm I called it a day, and here I am now, blogging and having a good roasted chicken to finish cooking in the oven. 
Here it is, in all its glory.

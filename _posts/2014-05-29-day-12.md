Usual big working day here, pairing with Julia and getting on with good results on the Boris Bikes project, [(here's the real one)](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/barclays-cycle-hire).

But today I feel like writing more about me and my inner feelings, since this project is hitting on a nerve. Emo shit will follow.

I fucking miss my bike. I actually loved her.

A lot.

I left her (yes, she's a lady) in Milan, and I still haven't copped one here in London, for a number of reasons. I miss riding her (no double entendre here) and cruising the city streets and alleys.
So I decided that next week I'll empty my pockets and buy another one, and yes, I know it sounds like betrayal, but I really need to surf this concrete jungle with some wheels.
Since my flat is relatively small and has no courtyard, I guess I'll settle for a [folding one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_bicycle), even if it sounds weird to have a bike that folds itself. We'll see.

On to the friday, anyway! Cheers lads.

Instagram app coding proceeding. I got quite boring with the idea of replicating exactly this service, and I tried to spice it up a little bit, converting it into my personal version. As a stereotypical Italian, I chose to style is as Pizzagram, a social network of inviting pizza pictures.

Yes, sometimes coding gets a little repetitive. Especially if you still are in a beginner stage, where every little details can cost pain and long struggles to be fixed. The drawback is that we have a pretty accurate model of how our code should look like, once we will be good at writing it.

But a good piece of advice I can give to the newbies like me is: find ways to make the example projects more personal. Experiment. Mess up a little bit. It will put you in the unknown and outside your comfort zone, which is where you wanna be, to learn faster and better.

I always wondered where does all this modern, good looking CSS that we see nowadays in web applications come from. Apparently the majority of it comes from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). If you look for a good and easy way to integrate fancy design into your application, give it a chance. It rocks.

Need a pizza now. Later!

Graduation day, today.

This means two things: our seniors are now officially Makers with all due honours, and that we, the mighty May clan, are Seniors.

I just can't believe that half the experience is already gone. Man, this journey is so short!

The projects presented by the guys at the ceremony were impressive: a beautifully interfaced task organizer, a clever online buy/sell platform, and a funny application to handle money collecting from friends when organizing a social event. Well done, March cohort.

What can I say about this first half, as seen from my eyes?

- I learned a lot, about myself more than about coding, in a way.
- I have great motivation, but not always the skill of channeling it in something positive.
- I broke my shoulder but still somehow managed to get along and keep working hard.
- I am a shy person, in a way. Capable of bonding with the cohort mates but less able to do so with the coaches and staff, maybe for a lack of faith in my spoken english? I always feel I don't understand everything completely, and I often retract from making questions and interacting. I want to do more, and I have the time to do so.

On a lighter note, watched the Italia game with Costa Rica while the graduation party was going. Worst idea ever. What a shitty team today.

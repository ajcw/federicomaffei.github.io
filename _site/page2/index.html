<p>Productive day, today, even if tiring as usual.</p>

<p>I notice that, at night, even if only a few hours passed since I coded, I can hardly remember exactly what happened to me during the day. Not to mention if I start thinking about the days before! It&#39;s all a confused blur of Ruby lines, team talking and a coffee every once in a while. I guess that everything will make sense when the course will be finished and the project will be out!</p>

<p>The WorkMap application is alive and kicking, if you were curious about it. If you weren&#39;t, no problem, it&#39;s going to be so famous you&#39;ll talk about it to your friends not too far along the line, chief.</p>

<p>The lion&#39;s share of work is still Google Maps related, since we are trying to filter the results on the map and show only the relevant results to the job-searching-user.</p>

<p>OK, OK, I&#39;ll post a glimpse of the main page. Taken at 9pm, while still trying to make it work.</p>

<p>More things to come in the next days. I&#39;ll sleep when I&#39;m dead.</p>

<p>Tough day, this second project day, definitely tougher than yesterday.</p>

<p>The team is still going strong, but I can feel we are slowly drifting away from our comfort zone (Rails and a bit of front end), to begin exploring the unknown.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the application we want to delivery next Sunday is based on <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>, and the challenges related are many. We want to be able to store job into markers, show and hide them according to the user input, and allow a pop-up with info to appear when a marker is clicked.</p>

<p>Today has been fairly productive, but I don&#39;t want to talk too much too soon. Everyone is working hard, and it feels good to be finally functional, typing with both my hands and not feeling pain. A sensation I learned not to take for granted.</p>

<p>Off to sleep, yo.</p>

    <p>Project WorkMap - day one.</p>

<p>Have to say it was a pretty good day, even better than I expected. It felt really nice to create the <a href="https://github.com/federicomaffei/WorkMap">GitHub repo</a> named WorkMap, and starting working on it.</p>

<p>We had a really brief standup meeting with Jordan via chat, then proceeded to pair (I worked with Robin, James W with Sasha, and James K acted as a plus one in their team). The day was fairly productive, and by the end of the afternoon we had tackled a good half of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29#Product_backlog">Product Backlogs</a> we wanted to work on. Everyone looked happy with the work done, and I am really glad of being part of the team.</p>

<p>Right now an employer can sign up, sign in, insert a new job, and see it on a nice Google Map. Not bad for now, huh?</p>

<p>Then in the evening I went with Valentina, Will, Kate and Margherita to a Burger competition called BurgerMonday. It was one of the two semifinals, and the food was amazing. The two contenders were Hawksmoor and Disco Bistro, both well renowned London resturants.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/burgers.jpg" alt="BURGERS"></p>

<p>Tough decision for me, but I had to vote for Hawksmoor, since the girl at the counter gave me a huge double burger to bias me. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>On to day two.</p>

        Weekend - Kick Off!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>Sunday, team meeting and time for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29">Scrum Kick-off.</a></p>

<p>This Scrum development framework, which we chose to use to build the final project, relies on three key roles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Product Owner: he Product Owner is typically the individual closest to the &quot;business side&quot; of the project. The Product Owner is typically charged by the organization to &quot;get this product out&quot;. In this case, Jordan.</p></li>
<li><p>The Development Team: cross-functional group of people who, among them, have all the necessary skills to deliver each increment of the product. In this case, us!</p></li>
<li><p>The Scrum Master: a facilitator, the interface between the Team and the Owner, that help the Team focusing on the work to be done. In this case, Jordan again!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We had two meetings: a <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/backlog-grooming.html">Backlog Grooming Session</a>, in which we analyzed the user stories we had in mind for the WorkMap product, and translated them into a Product Backlog, which is the list of the stories to be developed, ordered by priority. It is very important to keep the product simple and try to be delivering a working copy at the end of the first spring (first week, in our case).</p>

<p>Then, having decided which stories are most important for this first cycle of production (that we arleady know is called Spring), we had a <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning-meeting/">Spring Planning Meeting</a>, in which we tried to estimate how long it could take to develop and deliver each user story. To do that we used casino fiches. If we thought that the time needed to develop that feature was short we had to put a white fiche on the table, if medium a green one, if large a red one, if unbearably large a black one.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/fiches.jpg" alt="FICHES"></p>

<p>Now we have a good plan for next week. User stories that are to be analyzed, understood and put into code.</p>

<p>Exciting. I can&#39;t wait until it is Monday, and that should tell you how good it feels to be building something of our own.</p>

        Day 54.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>Not much blogging this week, I know.</p>

<p>But time has come, and I can tell you a bit more about the final project.</p>

<p>I have chosen to participate in a project that is a bit experimental. In fact I&#39;ll be developing an idea pitched by our marketing man Jordan, that offered to guide a group of us in two weeks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development</a> of a job-searching-and-posting platform called WorkMap.</p>

<p>I will be working with James W, Sasha, Robin, and James K.</p>

<p>Agile Development is based on a really simple and incisive manifesto, that reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools</p></li>
<li><p>Working software over Comprehensive documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation</p></li>
<li><p>Responding to change over Following a plan</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two weeks will be divided in two so-called Sprints, starting this Sunday, when we&#39;ll focus on building User Stories related to this project, and find out what we&#39;ll be developing first. Jordan will act as Product Owner, and we will discuss with him the requirements of the project, creating the Product Backlog. That first phase will be called Product Backlog Grooming session. Then we will estimate the time needed for completing each task related to the PBI, in a second part of the meeting called Sprint Planning Session.</p>

<p>Then on Monday we&#39;ll start coding! And I am really happy to say that while I&#39;m doing it, I&#39;m realizing I like it, and working on a weekend is not annoying at all. An this is the main answer I was expecting to have from these three months.</p>

<p>Good things to come. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to blog all over the completion of the finished product.</p>

<p>Oh, and tonight London sky looks pretty great. May you all have the weekend you wish for.</p>

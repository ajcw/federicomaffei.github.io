<p>Friday, here you come.</p>

<p>Another thing that happens here every two weeks is the infamous Retrospective. It happens like this: usually at 4pm we stop doing what we are doing and we concentrate on talking together about ways to improve the overall experience, giving feedback and sharing our view with fellow Makers.</p>

<p>All in all, I can&#39;t say that I love it. I wouldn&#39;t say that I hate it, but it goes on for a long couple of hours, and I have to stop what I am doing (that, being Friday, is often a challenge) and participate. This is usually my mindset when the retrospective begins.</p>

<p>But today I feel it went better than the other times. There was a part in which a couch was put at the center of the room, and we were supposed to talk if and only if we were sitting there. Usually I&#39;m not the bigger fan of talking in public unless I have something really meaningful to say, and since a lot of juniors were expressing their frustration and fear of not moving forward, I took a breath and sat.</p>

<p>I told to them about my experience, with the broken arm and the inability to write and type properly. If that did not stop me from going forward and doing my best to get the most out of it, nothing should stop them. Makers is supposed to be the beginning of a long line, not a closed circle. I hope my message was received well.</p>

<p>Off to Italy, to spend my birthday and have my arm checked, to see if it healed.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed.</p>

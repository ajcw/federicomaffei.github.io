  <p>Project WorkMap - day one.</p>

<p>Have to say it was a pretty good day, even better than I expected. It felt really nice to create the <a href="https://github.com/federicomaffei/WorkMap">GitHub repo</a> named WorkMap, and starting working on it.</p>

<p>We had a really brief standup meeting with Jordan via chat, then proceeded to pair (I worked with Robin, James W with Sasha, and James K acted as a plus one in their team). The day was fairly productive, and by the end of the afternoon we had tackled a good half of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29#Product_backlog">Product Backlogs</a> we wanted to work on. Everyone looked happy with the work done, and I am really glad of being part of the team.</p>

<p>Right now an employer can sign up, sign in, insert a new job, and see it on a nice Google Map. Not bad for now, huh?</p>

<p>Then in the evening I went with Valentina, Will, Kate and Margherita to a Burger competition called BurgerMonday. It was one of the two semifinals, and the food was amazing. The two contenders were Hawksmoor and Disco Bistro, both well renowned London resturants.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/burgers.jpg" alt="BURGERS"></p>

<p>Tough decision for me, but I had to vote for Hawksmoor, since the girl at the counter gave me a huge double burger to bias me. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>On to day two.</p>

  <p>Not much blogging this week, I know.</p>

<p>But time has come, and I can tell you a bit more about the final project.</p>

<p>I have chosen to participate in a project that is a bit experimental. In fact I&#39;ll be developing an idea pitched by our marketing man Jordan, that offered to guide a group of us in two weeks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development</a> of a job-searching-and-posting platform called WorkMap.</p>

<p>I will be working with James W, Sasha, Robin, and James K.</p>

<p>Agile Development is based on a really simple and incisive manifesto, that reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools</p></li>
<li><p>Working software over Comprehensive documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation</p></li>
<li><p>Responding to change over Following a plan</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two weeks will be divided in two so-called Sprints, starting this Sunday, when we&#39;ll focus on building User Stories related to this project, and find out what we&#39;ll be developing first. Jordan will act as Product Owner, and we will discuss with him the requirements of the project, creating the Product Backlog. That first phase will be called Product Backlog Grooming session. Then we will estimate the time needed for completing each task related to the PBI, in a second part of the meeting called Sprint Planning Session.</p>

<p>Then on Monday we&#39;ll start coding! And I am really happy to say that while I&#39;m doing it, I&#39;m realizing I like it, and working on a weekend is not annoying at all. An this is the main answer I was expecting to have from these three months.</p>

<p>Good things to come. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to blog all over the completion of the finished product.</p>

<p>Oh, and tonight London sky looks pretty great. May you all have the weekend you wish for.</p>

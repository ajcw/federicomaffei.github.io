  <p>No usual nerd code sample today.</p>

<p>No music links, no jokes, no nothing.</p>

<p>The last two days have been just bad. And they could have been worse, but my cohort mates and coaches really tried to make me feel part of the class.</p>

<p>I attended the lectures via Hangout, and Enrique made sure I had a proper audio and got every bit of the talks.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/enrique.png" alt="LECTURE"></p>

<p>I worked via remote with Johann, Kate, Will and Jamie. The weekly project is a Battleship game, but I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit lost and behind. Especially today I was really knocked out by painkillers and lack of sleep, and did not manage to help much during the designing and testing of the first classes. The guys were really supportive and patient.</p>

<p>My arm is senseless, and hurts like hell. I broke an ankle before, but this is really agony.</p>

<p>Plus, I do not know if I even stand the chance of finishing the cohort like this. I can&#39;t even type properly. I did not speak with Enrique or anyone of the coaches about this, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll receive any particular feedback if I do. It&#39;s all up to me.</p>

<p>I left my job, my country and my records to be here and become a developer. And now here I am, 4 weeks into the course and with one working arm less. Scared about the future, to say the least.</p>

<p>Wish me good, kind reader.</p>

<p>Intense week, as the Makers clich√© wants.</p>

<p>I am not updating the blog as much as I want, but it is not too easy with only one hand at my disposal.</p>

<p>We are approaching the sixth week, and in a while we will enter the second half of the course and become seniors. Time fled, as always when you do something that you enjoy a lot.</p>

<p>Right now the project we are working on is allowing us to put some pieces together: modeling data with the help of DataMapper, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch">Object Relational Mapper</a>, writing the main application in Ruby, and the user interface in ERB, which is basically still Ruby, but embedded in HTML. I feel like I&#39;m ready to write more descriptive posts about coding, and I&#39;ll start doing so as soon as I remove the bendage.</p>

<p>I still feel somehow confused by the amount of new information being thrown at me each day, but slowly getting used to it. And coding has a big upside: you can do it while listening to music, and this is giving me the chance to go through all of my favorite albums.</p>

<p>This week is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL5cun2kQ6M&amp;feature=kp">MF DOOM&#39;s</a> week. God how much I love this rap shit.</p>

<p>Week is busy.</p>

<p>Trying to move on with a slow but constant pace, not being able to write properly but still optimistic. We are quite confused, as a class, since the Ruby part of the course has been increasingly difficult and full of hurdles, and the morale of the troops is not the best.</p>

<p>Mine as well, considering my arm, but I&#39;m proud of myself, since I decided to write the Battleship thing again by myself, with decent results.</p>

<p>Today has been a fairly productive day, all in all. We are starting to address the front-end part of software development, that is the part that is closer to the user, and involves other languages. Leaving Ruby for a bit will be good. I don&#39;t want to be too focused on one thing, risking tunnel vision.</p>

<p>The weather here in London is being pretty amazing, and I want to share a picture I took when out of class tonight.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/london.jpg" alt="London"></p>

<p>Amazing, isn&#39;t it?
Plus the World Cup is about to start, and on Saturday it&#39;s going to be Italy vs. England. Can&#39;t wait!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not blogging every day now, and I regret it a little bit. I don&#39;t feel like doing so, and I prefer to save the only working hand I have left for coding as much as I can.</p>

<p>The days at Makers are long, we are still stuck on the battleships project that the class started when I was home, and no one seems to enjoy it that much. I am trying really hard to be level with the class, hoping to be better soon and kick ass.</p>

<p>On Monday Will gave me a little plastic scooter that I enjoyed very much. Overall I tried to have the best start of the week possible.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/scooter.jpg" alt="Scooter"></p>

<p>Here I am now, exhausted at home, typing with my left hand and trying to keep optimistic. Can&#39;t go much worse than now, anyway!
The last six months have been a rollercoaster of events and feelings. I made some big decisions. I felt awful at times, angry with the world and with people. This is my escape, I felt so better after making up my mind, and I&#39;ll go all the way, no matter what.</p>

<p>Erick Sermon and Parish Smith know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noegD-jIw5Y">their shit</a>.</p>

<p>Today I bumped hard their album Back in Business. Why?</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/beatles.jpg" alt="Beatles"></p>

<p>Federico is like a Beatle, back with another single! Yes, I&#39;m back in London, back at Makers, and back for good.</p>

<p>I have been in a hospital in Italy, on a plane to UK and at school until 19 pm all the same day. So excuse me while I kiss my pillow. Nite!</p>

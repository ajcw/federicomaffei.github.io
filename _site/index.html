    <h3 id="introduction-to-rest">Introduction to REST</h3>

<p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer.</p>

<p>It is an architectural style used to build Web Services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. A service that uses it is called a <strong>RESTful service</strong>. REST is not strictly dependent on any protocol, but very often uses HTTP.</p>

<p>The purpose of a web service can be summed up as follows: it exposes <strong>resources</strong> to its <strong>clients</strong> so that they can access them (example of typical resources: pictures, video files, web pages, business data).</p>

<p>Common features of a service that is built in a REST style are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Representations</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>URIs</li>
<li>Uniform Interface</li>
<li>Stateless</li>
<li>Links between resources</li>
<li>Caching</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="representations---what-are-they?">Representations - what are they?</h3>

<p>REST style does not put a constraint into the way resources are represented.</p>

<p>Good examples of data formats in which a resource could be returned from a service are <strong>JSON</strong> (JavaScript Object Notation, which nowadays is the coolest one) and <strong>XML</strong> (Extensible Markup Language, used for more complex data structures). Say for instance a REST service has to expose the data related to a song, with its attributes. A way of doing it in JSON could be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;ID&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;title&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;(You gotta) Fight for your right (To party)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;artist&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Beastie Boys&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;album&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Licensed To Ill&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;year&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1986</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;genre&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hip-Hop&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Easy, huh?</p>

<p>Anyway, a service can represent a resource in a number of ways at the same time, leaving the client to choose which one is better suited for its needs. The important thing is that there is agreement on what format to send/expect.</p>

<p>The format that the client needs will be part of the <strong>request</strong> sent by the client.</p>

<p>The resource will be eventually sent by the service as part of what we call a <strong>response</strong>.</p>

<p>It has to be kept in mind that a resource should be completely described by the representation, since this is the only information the client will have. It has to be exaustive, but without exposing classified or useless information about the entity at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="messages-a.k.a.-client-and-service-chatting">Messages A.K.A. client and service chatting</h3>

<p>Q: So, how do exactly client and service exchange requests and responses?</p>

<p>A: They send messages.</p>

<p>In fact, to be more specific, the client will send an <strong>HTTP request</strong> to the service, specifying the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>method</strong> that is called on the resource. It can correspond to a <em>GET</em>, a <em>POST</em>, a <em>PUT</em>, a <em>DELETE</em>, an <em>OPTIONS</em> or a <em>HEAD</em> operation.</li>
<li>The <strong>URI</strong> of the request. It identifies what is the resource on which the client wants to use the method on. More on that later. For now let&#39;s say it is the only way the client know how to call the needed resource.</li>
<li>The <strong>HTTP version</strong>, which is usually <em>HTTP/1.1</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>request headers</strong>, which are the additional information passed, with the request, to the service. These fields are basically request modifiers, similar to the parameters sent to a programming language method, and they depend on the type of request sent. More on that later.</li>
<li>The <strong>request body</strong>: is the actual content of a message. In a RESTful service, itâ€™s where the representation of resources sit. A body will not be present in a GET request, for instance, since it is a request to retrieve a resource rather than to create one, whereas a POST request will most likely have one.</li>
</ul>

<p>The request will then generate an <strong>HTTP response</strong> to the client, that will contain the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>HTTP version</strong>, same as above.</li>
<li>the <strong>response code</strong>: which is a three-digit status code sent back to the client. Can be of the <strong>1xx</strong> format (informational), <strong>2xx</strong> (success), <strong>3xx</strong> (redirect), <strong>4xx</strong> (client error), <strong>5xx</strong> (server error).</li>
<li>the <strong>response header</strong>, which contains metadata and settings related to the message.</li>
<li>the <strong>response body</strong>: contains the representation (if the request was successful).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="uris,-home-of-the-resources">URIs, home of the resources</h3>

<p>A requirement of REST is that each resource has to correspond to an URI address, which unsurprisingly stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. Having URIs associated to resources is key, because they are the addresses on which the client is allowed to perform the operations on the resources. It is important to stress that according to REST an URI should describe a resource, but never the operation performed on it.</p>

<p>The addresses are usually constructed hierarchically, to allow readability. A typical resource URL could be written as:
<strong>http://serviceName/resourceName/resourceID</strong></p>

<p>Basic guidelines to build well-structured URIs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resources should be named with plural nouns, no verbs, using conventions throughout the whole service.</li>
<li>Query URIs (http://serviceName/resourceName?id=resourceID) should be used only when really necessary. They are not deprecated by REST style, but they are less readable than the normal URIs, and are ignored by search engines. On the upside, they allow the client to send parameters to the service, to refine the request for a specific subset of resources, or resources in a specific format.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="uniform-interface,-various-operations">Uniform interface, various operations</h3>

<p>Ok, so now that a client knows where a resource is reachable, how is it going to handle the resource? What are the operations that it can perform?</p>

<p>HTTP provides a set of methods that allow the client to perform standard operations on the service:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Operation performed</th>
<th>Quality</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>GET</strong></td>
<td>Read a resource</td>
<td>Safe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>POST</strong></td>
<td>Insert a new resource, or update an existing one</td>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>PUT</strong></td>
<td>Insert a new resource, or update an existing one</td>
<td>Idempotent (see below)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DELETE</strong></td>
<td>Delete a resource</td>
<td>Idempotent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>OPTIONS</strong></td>
<td>List allowed operations on a resource</td>
<td>Safe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>HEAD</strong></td>
<td>Return only the response header, no body</td>
<td>Safe</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The key difference between <em>POST</em> and <em>PUT</em> is that no matter how many times a <em>PUT</em> operation is performed, the result will be the same (this is what <em>idempotent</em> means), whereas with a <em>POST</em> operation a resource will be added or updated multiple times.</p>

<p>Another difference is that a client that sends a <em>PUT</em> request always need to know the exact URI to operate on, I.E. assigning a name or an ID to a resource. If the client is not able to do so, it has no choice but to use a POST request.</p>

<p>Finally, if the resource already exists, <em>POST</em> and <em>PUT</em> will update it in an identical fashion.</p>

<h3 id="statelessness-of-the-client-side">Statelessness of the client side</h3>

<p>A RESTful service does not maintain the application state client-side. This only allow the client to perform requests that are resource specific, and does not allow the client to perform operations that assume prior knowledge of past requests.</p>

<h3 id="links-between-resources">Links between resources</h3>

<p>in the case of a resource that contains a list of resources, REST suggests to include links to the single resources on the representation, to keep it compact and avoid redundant data.</p>

<h3 id="caching-to-optimize-time-and-efficiency">Caching to optimize time and efficiency</h3>

<p>Allows to store responses and return them if the same request is performed again. It has to be handled carefully to avoid returning stale results. The headers that allow us to perform controls over caching are:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Header</th>
<th>Application</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Date</strong></td>
<td>Finding out when this representation was generated</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Last Modified</strong></td>
<td>Date and time when the server modified the representation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cache-Control</strong></td>
<td>HTTP 1.1 header used to control caching, can contain directives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Expires</strong></td>
<td>Expiration date (supports HTTP 1.0)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Age</strong></td>
<td>Duration since the resource was fetched from server</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Cache-Control values can be tweaked to control if a cached result is still valid or stale. For example, the <em>max-age</em> value indicates for how many seconds from the moment expressed by the Date header a cached result will be valid.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>REST is a language-agnostic style that allows to build scalable, reusable and relatively lightweight web services. Thinking about it, seems that REST is nothing more than a description of the characteristics that made the World Wide Web so popular.</p>

<p>That of course is encouraging developer from all over the world to comply to these very basic ideas, owned by no one but at the same time used by everyone.</p>

        New Job.

    <span class="post-date">17 Nov 2014</span>

    <p>After three months I am a bit scared to reopen the blog. Like you&#39;d be scared of eating something that has been left in a fridge for the same amount of time.</p>

<p>Yes, in this tech thing three months without any update make something old and stale. And maybe that&#39;s why I love it.</p>

<p>But anyway...</p>

<p>I found a job, in an amazing <a href="http://www.opentable.co.uk">company</a> that seemed to believe I wasn&#39;t cheating when I said I actually started to write computer code less than 6 months ago.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/ot.jpg" alt="OPENTABLE"></p>

<p>So I think it is time to blow some dust off the blog, and use it to write less personal and more technical posts, that I&#39;m sure at the beginning will be very rudimentary, but hopefully at some point progress and start being interesting for the reader.
A key concept that is oldie but goldie: teaching and writing about topics is the way to learn and master them. Or at least make it seem you do ;)</p>

<p>And when that time will come, I&#39;ll aim higher and try to be more opinionated, updated about technologies and understand the why, not only the how.</p>

<p>Go.</p>

        Graduation!

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>It&#39;s often wise to sit down and let some time pass after something important happens in your life, before trying to get some sense out of it, especially if you want to write some stuff about it.</p>

<p>I am a Makers Academy graduate, in the end. This has been a wild ride. Something I will not forget, ever.</p>

<p>Graduation day has been very similar to the whole experience: a rollercoaster of emotions, good and bad ones, as often happens in 25, City Road. My cohort mates&#39; projects were all incredible and clearly showed eveyone how people get real skills here.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start talking a bit about the good things and peoples: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The project, which has been an invaluable test for both coding and working in a team. I would be really glad if you, kind reader, would like to check the final product out at: <a href="http://workmap.herokuapp.com/">http://workmap.herokuapp.com/</a></p></li>
<li><p>The classmates and teammates, people that will go very far in life, all of them, I have no doubt about that. I hope not to lose contact with anyone, and I will put effort in making sure that doesn&#39;t happen.</p></li>
<li><p>The teachers and coaches, which I will never thank enough for their dedication, patience and commitment.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone working for Makers. The team is extraordinary, and made of lovely people who also make great professionals.</p></li>
<li><p>Me. I usually refrain from patting myself on the back, but all in all I feel proud of myself. It&#39;s not easy to endure such an intensive class, and I did it, even with a broken arm. Well done!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The only bad things that I can think of is that I didn&#39;t like the presentation speech I gave to explain part of the final project to the people attending the graduation Open Day. I got too emotional, did not manage to talk the way I wanted about the amazing features my team built. I want to improve on that, and together with finding a good job, this is now my most important task to do. Public speaking is important, and I know I can do better.</p>

<p>Makers never stops teaching you lessons, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, off to the seaside. I&#39;ll use the blog to talk about coding anyway in the future, so this won&#39;t be the last time you hear from me. Thanks for reading, I be out.</p>

<p>Hectic day today, started with the usual Standup Meeting with Jordan. Here&#39;s all the team, glorious screenshot.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/meeting.png" alt="MEETING"></p>

<p>Then we went on with the development of our creature, WorkMap. The deadline to deliver a shippable product, as per Agile specifications, is this Sunday. Then we&#39;ll begin the second and last Sprint.</p>

<p>This means a rush of four days, in which we have to tackle 3 main aims:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Be sure that all the jobs inserted by the employer are in the map, and allow the user to filter them.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a good looking landing page.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure that the employer can edit the jobs he inserted, and pays for the newly added advert.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Today I have been working with Robin, trying to tackle the jobs filtering on the map. It turned out that all the code that I wrote to make checkboxes filter results was pretty useless, since now we settled for a filtering form, allow us to render the results of the search in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON format</a>. This way we can pass all the information related to jobs from the Rails back end to the Javascript front end, and viceversa.</p>

<p>Anyway, two full days of work to Sunday. Better get some rest, yo.</p>

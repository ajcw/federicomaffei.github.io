<p>Friday, here you come.</p>

<p>Another thing that happens here every two weeks is the infamous Retrospective. It happens like this: usually at 4pm we stop doing what we are doing and we concentrate on talking together about ways to improve the overall experience, giving feedback and sharing our view with fellow Makers.</p>

<p>All in all, I can&#39;t say that I love it. I wouldn&#39;t say that I hate it, but it goes on for a long couple of hours, and I have to stop what I am doing (that, being Friday, is often a challenge) and participate. This is usually my mindset when the retrospective begins.</p>

<p>But today I feel it went better than the other times. There was a part in which a couch was put at the center of the room, and we were supposed to talk if and only if we were sitting there. Usually I&#39;m not the bigger fan of talking in public unless I have something really meaningful to say, and since a lot of juniors were expressing their frustration and fear of not moving forward, I took a breath and sat.</p>

<p>I told to them about my experience, with the broken arm and the inability to write and type properly. If that did not stop me from going forward and doing my best to get the most out of it, nothing should stop them. Makers is supposed to be the beginning of a long line, not a closed circle. I hope my message was received well.</p>

<p>Off to Italy, to spend my birthday and have my arm checked, to see if it healed.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed.</p>

    <p>Thursday has always been one of my least favorite days of the week. I can&#39;t really say why. Bad memories are often always associated with Thursdays, in my life.</p>

<p>Week has been quite tough, and at this time of the day I feel more inclined not to blog about coding today. Tired does not describe what I am. This is a shame, since we are doing great things at Makers. But I&#39;ll talk about that another day.</p>

<p>Tonight I found a beautiful Thursday-related poem, by <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_St._Vincent_Millay">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a>, which is the one I put in my pseudo-code trademark style.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;And if I loved you Wednesday,&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Well, what is that to you?&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;I do not love you Thursday&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;So much is true.&#39;</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;And why you come complaining&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Is more than I can see.&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;I loved you Wednesday, yes, but what&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Is that to me?&#39;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The journey in the Yelp-like application is continuing.
Today we worked on <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html">data validations</a> via Active Record, which is the Rails layer responsible for the model and data handling.</p>

<p>I am quite exausted so I don&#39;t feel like writing a long post. But I&#39;m quite happy with what we have done so far.</p>

<p>We are able to handle data insertion, validation and handle events on the web page via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a>.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ll try a better overview of the application when I&#39;ll see it finished.</p>

<p>And shout outs to KA, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1hDpufNXd0">Night&#39;s Gambit</a> is helping me to be up till late working.</p>

<p>So, Rails, here we go.</p>

<p>This framework works following the <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/intermediate-rails-understanding-models-views-and-controllers/">MVC paradigm</a>. This means that we always design the behavior of the application using three entities: Models, Views, and Controllers.</p>

<p>This means that every communication between the browser (the user side, your side, kind reader) and our application is handled by the Controller. The particular requests are handled and dispatched via Routes, that allow the controller to activate the Model, retrieve the data and ask the View to display it.</p>

<p>Models are Ruby classes, that perform operations with the database, validate the data, execute low-level operations on it, and then return it to the controller to be routed to views. They do it using the class ActiveRecord::Base, that allows binding between the Ruby class and Database tables (in our case, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">PostgreSQL</a>). I&#39;ll write more about Rails/DB interaction very soon.</p>

<p>Views are the artists of the flat: they use HyperText Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and a vast number of <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/%7Eachaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Client-side_scripting.html">client-side scripting languages</a> to display nicely the required content or asset to the end-user. They don&#39;t know what is happening behind the scenes: they just want go onstage and rock that crowd!</p>

<p>Overall I am liking Rails, and I feel that this blog will be more and more tech-oriented as time passes and my confidence in what I know increases. I am a developer, after all, so why not share what I am learning?</p>

<p>On a lighter note, tonight I went to celebrate Canada Day at Birthdays, a nice Dalston bar. Unfortunately I did not manage to try their famous Poutine dish because they ran off of it (it was full of Canadians craving for it), but will definitely do as soon as I have the chance. I balanced with a couple of great IPA beers, so not bad at all.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/poutine.jpg" alt="POUTINE"></p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you know if I like as soon as I get another chance to have that. Artist of the week? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuHkUq1uSqE">THE CHEF.</a></p>

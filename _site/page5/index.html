<p>Well, seems that the JavaScript and jQuery galore has reached high peaks here at Makers.
We used the <a href="http://federicomaffei.github.io/2014/06/25/day-37/">GitHub API</a> so much that they blocked us and left us without our test platform, since if they receive to many requests at once they are forced to block the IP address that sent them (us, in this case).</p>

<p>At least no one can say that we are not hard workers at Makers, right?</p>

<p>This led me and Julia to pair program together, with the aim to build an app that uses <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram APIs</a> instead of the blocked GitHub ones. We thought that it could have been fun to fiddle with APIs a little bit, both of us being Instagram enthusiasts. And we were right!</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/instagram.jpg" alt="INSTAGRAM"></p>

<p>After some time we managed to reach some nice and pleasant results, like a little application that allows you to find and show photos by searching a tag. Here&#39;s a little screenshot. Overall a productive and fun day.</p>

<p>On to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGgMZpGYiy8">Friday</a>, then!</p>

<p>Javascript and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery">jQuery</a> madness going on at Makers.
Today I actually posted here a chunk of code I have written, instead of the usual mocking one, since I am quite proud of it.</p>

<p>Alex showed us how to develop a dynamic content page which retrieves data from <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and shows it as a result of a search. This means that now our static HTML is powered by the combination of Javascript and jQuery (which is basically a library that has access to the HTML document and extends Javascript, allowing to retrieve, process and add content from and to the page itself).</p>

<p>In this case we have learned how to take an user&#39;s input (a GitHub username) and via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a> obtain data about that user (username, avater, followers, repos) and put that into the page in a nice and animated way.</p>

<p>Of course this new language is hard to  grasp. Of course programming in Ruby was like talking in Italian while JS looks a bit like English, in a way. But this is a time of challenges, so how bad can be another one? Plus this thing of being able to handle data from big applications and sites is fascinating.</p>

<p>On another side of my life - flatmates are moving back to Paris, and this means I have to look for a new flat this week. I&#39;ll miss them!</p>

<p>Beginning of the week and beginning of this second half of the Makers adventure.</p>

<p>Alex took over the lectures, and begun to teach us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> right away. It is another language, totally different from Ruby (it is a client-side language and the syntax differs to some extent). But in the end I liked switching from a language to another. It adds spice to the already tasty coding dish.</p>

<p>We are building a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> application, and it seems real fun to fiddle around with Javascript. Nice effects can be added to the static pages, and even if setting them up is not always straightforward, I am having a good time. Maybe it is also because my shoulder is getting relatively better, not that I can type, but at least I carry on through the day without painkillers, and I manage to remove the bandage every evening for at least a couple hours.</p>

<p>All going to be fine!</p>

<p>Except Italy, we are out the World Cup and we played like shit. Well deserved, Uruguay. Except for you, Suarez, you biting cheat.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/suarez.jpg" alt="SUAREZ"></p>

<p>But anyway, what can I say. I love football, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMO5Ko_77Hk">love is a losing game</a>.</p>

<p>At least for me, it has always been like that, and maybe always will be.</p>

<p>Graduation day, today.</p>

<p>This means two things: our seniors are now officially Makers with all due honours, and that we, the mighty May clan, are Seniors.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t believe that half the experience is already gone. Man, this journey is so short!</p>

<p>The projects presented by the guys at the ceremony were impressive: a beautifully interfaced task organizer, a clever online buy/sell platform, and a funny application to handle money collecting from friends when organizing a social event. Well done, March cohort.</p>

<p>What can I say about this first half, as seen from my eyes?</p>

<ul>
<li>I learned a lot, about myself more than about coding, in a way.</li>
<li>I have great motivation, but not always the skill of channeling it in something positive.</li>
<li>I broke my shoulder but still somehow managed to get along and keep working hard.</li>
<li>I am a shy person, in a way. Capable of bonding with the cohort mates but less able to do so with the coaches and staff, maybe for a lack of faith in my spoken english? I always feel I don&#39;t understand everything completely, and I often retract from making questions and interacting. I want to do more, and I have the time to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>On a lighter note, watched the Italia game with Costa Rica while the graduation party was going. Worst idea ever. What a shitty team today. </p>

<p>Databases, Data Mappers, Data models.</p>

<p>We seem to be introducing data handling and security in our coding skills, aren&#39;t we?</p>

<p>Today the March cohort rehearsed the presentation of their final projects, which they&#39;ll show tomorrow at the graduation day. The applications they built seem really cool and based on good ideas. I&#39;ll be happy to attend the ceremony and check them out.</p>

<p>Plus, starting tomorrow we&#39;ll be seniors, the eldest in Makers Academy and the grown ups, so to speak. I like the idea.</p>

<p>I stayed until late today at Makers, watching the game with some of the guys. Here&#39;s how my coding setup was:</p>

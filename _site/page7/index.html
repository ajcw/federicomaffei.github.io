        Days 14 and 15 - HELL.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>No usual nerd code sample today.</p>

<p>No music links, no jokes, no nothing.</p>

<p>The last two days have been just bad. And they could have been worse, but my cohort mates and coaches really tried to make me feel part of the class.</p>

<p>I attended the lectures via Hangout, and Enrique made sure I had a proper audio and got every bit of the talks.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/enrique.png" alt="LECTURE"></p>

<p>I worked via remote with Johann, Kate, Will and Jamie. The weekly project is a Battleship game, but I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit lost and behind. Especially today I was really knocked out by painkillers and lack of sleep, and did not manage to help much during the designing and testing of the first classes. The guys were really supportive and patient.</p>

<p>My arm is senseless, and hurts like hell. I broke an ankle before, but this is really agony.</p>

<p>Plus, I do not know if I even stand the chance of finishing the cohort like this. I can&#39;t even type properly. I did not speak with Enrique or anyone of the coaches about this, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll receive any particular feedback if I do. It&#39;s all up to me.</p>

<p>I left my job, my country and my records to be here and become a developer. And now here I am, 4 weeks into the course and with one working arm less. Scared about the future, to say the least.</p>

<p>Wish me good, kind reader.</p>

<p>Plans are great, unless they fail and leave you diving deep into a shit pool.</p>

<p>How it was supposed to be: go to Italy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlrqaAjBwS4">attend wedding and party with old time friends like there&#39;s no tomorrow</a>, take a plane on Monday morning and be at Makers by lunch.</p>

<p>How it actually went: a scooter ran over me on Saturday night, my right shoulder broke in two points, spent the night at the hospital, still went to the wedding and tried to drink away the pain, woke up today in the worst pain I ever experienced.</p>

<p>Now, stuck here in Italy for the next two days, I&#39;m awaiting for a x-ray check, unable to write or do anything else with my arm, and not sleeping from pain. But still trying to be optimistic and not give up.</p>

<p>Not give up.</p>

<p>I will not give up.</p>

<p>I will not give up.</p>

<p>I will not give up.</p>

<p>I will not give up.</p>

<p>I will not give up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8mht4FuVrU">Friday, venerd√¨</a>, again.
After a quick calculation, that can be done without any coding, one third of the course already flew.</p>

<p>33,3333333333%.</p>

<p>Today was challenge day, and I must say I find myself really at ease while trying to complete the test, way more than following the code proposed in the weekly project. It was something related to traffic control applied to the case of an airport. Nothing too difficult, it took me three hours to go through it and it was interesting.</p>

<p>But anyway, enough with the coding adventures. Tomorrow at 6am I have to catch a plane to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancona">my hometown</a>, and I&#39;ll be there for a couple of days to attend the wedding of one of my best friends.
I can&#39;t wait to be there, it&#39;s been quite long since last time I&#39;ve been back. I&#39;ll post a couple pictures of the wedding on Monday.</p>

<p>Ah, and my beard is starting to look like a real coder&#39;s one.</p>

<p>Usual big working day here, pairing with Julia and getting on with good results on the Boris Bikes project, <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/barclays-cycle-hire">(here&#39;s the real one)</a>.</p>

<p>But today I feel like writing more about me and my inner feelings, since this project is hitting on a nerve. Emo shit will follow.</p>

<p>I fucking miss my bike. I actually loved her.</p>

<p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/bike.jpg" alt="MY ONLY LOVE"></p>

<p>A lot.</p>

<p>I left her (yes, she&#39;s a lady) in Milan, and I still haven&#39;t copped one here in London, for a number of reasons. I miss riding her (no double entendre here) and cruising the city streets and alleys.
So I decided that next week I&#39;ll empty my pockets and buy another one, and yes, I know it sounds like betrayal, but I really need to surf this concrete jungle with some wheels.
Since my flat is relatively small and has no courtyard, I guess I&#39;ll settle for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_bicycle">folding one</a>, even if it sounds weird to have a bike that folds itself. We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>On to the friday, anyway! Cheers lads.</p>

<p>Giant leaps forward this week at Makers.
Today we started talking seriously about the concepts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29">encapsulation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29">class inheritance</a>.</p>

<p>Basically it takes what we&#39;ve learned so far about classes to another level, allowing us to take advantage of similarities between classes, and extending them using the methods we already declared.</p>

<p>The day was productive, I paired with Johann and we completed a good part of the week project.</p>

<p>Off-topic: I am so glad it is Wednesday and I can go relieve my stress in a football pitch. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hFH3q5bz1Q">Big Wednesday!</a></p>

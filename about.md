Hi there, I'm [Federico](https://github.com/federicomaffei).
30 years old, Italian, I've just moved to London to test myself and see if I am capable of becoming a software developer.
The starting point of my adventure is [Makers Academy](http://http://www.makersacademy.com/).

I'll leave this section quite empty for now, hoping that at some point my code will do the talk for me.

Here's how to reach me:
